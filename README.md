# End-to-End Modeling with Deep Learning

This repository contains implementations of three deep learning models for different tasks using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The models are integrated with **TensorBoard** for experiment tracking and visualization.

## üìå Project Overview
Deep learning has revolutionized various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. This project provides an end-to-end implementation of three different deep learning models, covering classification, regression, and image classification. By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, the models ensure scalability and efficiency. The models are also integrated with TensorBoard for detailed experiment tracking and analysis.
This project demonstrates **end-to-end deep learning modeling** for:
1. **Classification** - Fashion MNIST dataset (Multi-class classification)
2. **Regression** - Synthetic dataset (Predicting continuous values)
3. **Image Classification** - CIFAR-10 dataset (Classifying objects in images)

Each model follows a structured pipeline:
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Model Architecture Design**
- **Training and Evaluation**
- **Performance Metrics and Visualization**
- **Experiment Tracking with TensorBoard**
